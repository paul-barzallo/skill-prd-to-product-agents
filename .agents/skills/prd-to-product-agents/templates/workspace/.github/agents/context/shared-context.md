# Shared Agent Context

This file provides the baseline domain and technical context that every assembled agent receives before any role-specific overlay is appended.

## Project Context

<!-- injected: seed by bootstrap -->
<!-- Shared across all 9 agents. Maintained by product-owner via enrich-agents-from-prd. -->
<!-- context-version: 2026-03-09 -->

- Product goal: bootstrap a VS Code and GitHub Copilot workspace for governed multi-agent product delivery.
- Operating model: canonical state lives in Markdown and YAML under `docs/project`; GitHub Issues, Projects, and PRs drive execution; Git provides historical context.
- Fixed agent set: 9 base agents with strict authority boundaries, explicit handoff routes, and immutable identity contracts.
- Core artifacts after bootstrap: vision, scope, backlog, refined stories, acceptance criteria, risks, quality gates, releases, handoffs, findings, and context summary.
- Workflow expectation: coordinators route work, tech-lead decomposes delivery into GitHub Issues, specialists execute on task branches, and every significant action remains traceable through canonical files and Git history.
- Delivery rule: file-based artifacts under `docs/project` are the single source of truth for all operational state.
- Refresh trigger: replace this section after PRD or scope changes using `enrich-agents-from-prd`.

## Technical Context

<!-- injected: seed by bootstrap -->
<!-- Shared across all agents. Maintained by software-architect via enrich-agents-from-architecture. -->

- Primary runtime surface: native Rust CLIs; shell snippets are auxiliary helpers for environment setup or CI only.
- Agent assembly model: `identity/{name}.md` + divider + `context/shared-context.md` + `context/{name}.md` -> generated `.agent.md` artifact.
- Validation surface: workspace validation, smoke tests, YAML and Markdown checks, PR governance checks, freshness warnings, and CI workflow enforcement.
- State operations: file-first CLI commands create and update handoffs, findings, releases, and activity records.
- Source layout: `docs/project` for canonical state, `.github` for agents/prompts/instructions, `scripts` for automation, `.state` for infrastructure reports.
- Context injection layers: Layer 1 `product-owner`, Layer 2 `software-architect`, Layer 3 `tech-lead` for developer implementation guidance.
- Refresh trigger: replace this section after architecture or implementation map changes using `enrich-agents-from-architecture`.

## Git Context

<!-- Shared across all agents. GitHub is execution context plus read/write delivery workflow. -->

- Git history is a formal context source. Agents read commit logs, diffs, blame, PRs, issues, and tags to inform decisions.
- GitHub Issues + GitHub Projects are the execution board for assigned work, status, blockers, and release framing.
- Canonical files under `docs/project` always take precedence over Git history if they diverge.
- Agents with `execute` may run git and `gh` commands needed to sync `develop`, work on task branches, commit, push, and update PRs.
- Every branch follows `<role>/<issue-id>-slug` from `develop`, and merges return through PRs instead of direct pushes.
- `devops-release-engineer` is the final approval gate before merge; `pm-orchestrator` and `tech-lead` keep task flow visible.
